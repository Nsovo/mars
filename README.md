# mars rover 

The solution has been solved using command pattern.
I have also used an interface to enforce behaivor of a rover.
There are 3 main components in the interface that is implemented by the rover
 Moveforward  
 TurnLeft
 TurnRight
 
Lastly I added a console app to to retrieve rovers to be deployed
and determine their position.


Assumptions
1. coordinates are integer
2. When deploying reovers only one will move at a time

Further work(what i would have loved to do).
-Error handling
-Displaying the position of the rover after it has been deployed
